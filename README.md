# Hi, I'm Eva

Bioinformatician turned data scientist. Currently a visiting researcher at **UC Irvine** working on deep learning for biomedical imaging: specifically, predicting chemoresistance at the single-cell level in breast cancer. This is my Master's thesis work under Professor Pierre Baldi, funded by the Balsells Fellowship.

Previously, I worked as a software developer at Geprom (Telefónica Tech) on industrial data spaces, and as a research assistant at IBEC, where I applied machine learning to respiratory medicine and co-authored a paper in *Critical Care Medicine*.

I studied Bioinformatics at ESCI-UPF and I'm finishing my MSc in Data Science at UPC.
